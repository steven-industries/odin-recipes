    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Shrimp is delicious no matter how you prepare it, but for seafood that’s ready in less than five minutes, 
        give it a dry-brine and a quick toss in the air fryer.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces (340g) raw peeled and deveined jumbo (16/20) shrimp, tail on (see notes)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half much by volume</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (14g) unsalted butter, melted (or neutral oil)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using paper towels, pat shrimp dry. In a medium bowl, toss shrimp with salt, baking soda, 
            and sugar until evenly coated. Arrange shrimp on a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet 
            and refrigerate, uncovered, for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat a 6-quart air fryer to 400℉ (205ºC) for 5 minutes. Using paper towels, pat shrimp 
            dry again, transfer to a large bowl, and toss with melted butter to coat.</li>
        <li>Arrange shrimp in air fryer basket in a single layer, making sure shrimp are not 
            touching each other. Cook, undisturbed, until shrimp are cooked through and have just 
            turned opaque, about 4 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>

    </ol>
